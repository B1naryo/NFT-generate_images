NFT Image Generator
This Python script generates images by randomly combining facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and face. The resulting images can be used to create unique characters, icons, or any other application involving pixel art.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pillow library (PIL)
You can install the Pillow library using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install Pillow
How to Use
Clone the repository or download the generate_images.py script.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python3 generate_images.py
The script will generate a large image composed of several individual pixelated images.

Customization
You can customize the facial features by adjusting the folders and files available in the face, eye, ear, mouth, and nose folders. Add or remove files in these folders to change the options available for each feature.

Generation Status
The script displays status messages during generation to inform about the progress and to ensure that each generated image is unique, avoiding repetitions.
